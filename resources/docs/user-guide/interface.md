## User interface


----

## Editor

The session editor can be enabled in the side panel. Once enabled, clicking on a widget or on a tab will make it the *selected object*, adding a fancy dashed blue border to it.


### Properties

All the selected object's properties are displayed and can be modified in the side panel. Any modification will redraw the object **and all its children** if the submitted data is valid. Please refer to the [widgets reference](widgets-generics.md) for the list of valid options.

Widgets containers such as tabs, strips and panels will also list their children here, which can be reordered using drag-and-drop.

### Size / Position

The selected object can be resized using its south, south-east and east handles. It can be dragged with its north handle.


### Context menu

Right clicking on a widget or on a tab will also display a context menu providing useful utilities :

- `copy`: copy widget's data
- `cut`: copy widget's data and delete selected widget
- `paste`: paste copied widget in selected container
- `Add widget`: create a new widget in selected container
- `Add tab`: create a new tab in selected container
- `Delete`: delete selected tab or widget
