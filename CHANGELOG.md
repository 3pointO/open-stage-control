## 0.4.4

  - fader and knob pip scales now support custom label
  - a push/toggle's value can be set to `null` if only the path needs to be sent in the osc messages

##Â 0.4.3

  - text widget can be `vertical`
  - panel widget `scroll` option
- bug fixes
  - smart pasting now works when the clipboard contains several widgets whose unsuffixed ids are the identical
  - osc received array that contain only one item are correctly unpacked (fixes cross-app sync for widgets that don't accept array, broken since the introduction of `preArgs`)

- misc
  - push widget doesn't fire its 'on' value if pressed while stuck in 'on' position
  - panel widgets don't have inner margins anymore
